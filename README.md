# Among-Us-Discord-Bot-Python
A Discord Bot that can complete various tasks for users
The tasks are meant to help assist the leader of the discord server to quickly make adjustments on said server while playing among us

What is discord? 
Discord is a text and voice communication service
What is among us?
Among us is a game that can be played with up to ten friends, in which one traitor or "imposter" tries to kill the others without being caught

Purpose of program:
My friend was tired of having to constantly mute each player as they are found dead or alive. During certain phases of the game, some people can talk and others must be muted. This program helps to speed this process up, along with having other utilites included such as the ability to silence people and clear chat.

Implementation:
This python application was uploaded to Hikaru, which allows for the server to be up at anytime, as long as the bot is turned on.
Hikaru is a platform that provides free cloud servers
